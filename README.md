# Demo-Projects
This project is to build a multitier application with a webserver.
This is a microservice application. It is simple to understand only if you have working knowledge of microservice architecture.
You need to clone this repo, create the deployment in your kubernetes clusters and create the various deployments and services with kubectl create -f (deployment or service name),
Once they are create and up and running, you can access the application through the web browser by user the IP and port number as soon in the service port.
